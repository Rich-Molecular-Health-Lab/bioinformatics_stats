Cohort: A group of organisms of the same species that are born during the same year or the same breeding season

x: Age, or time elapsed since the birth date of the cohort (usually in years).

S(x): Survivors, or Census size – the number of individuals in the cohort who survived to time x.

D(x): Deaths – the number of age x individuals in the cohort who died before reaching age x+1

Birth rate, b(x): Average number of offspring produced by an individual in age category x (per-capita birth rate for individuals of age x).

Survivorship, l(x): 𝑙(𝑥)=𝑆𝑥𝑆0(Eq. 1)
, where 𝑆𝑥
is the number of survivors from the original cohort at year 𝑥
. Survivorship represents the fraction of the cohort that is expected to survive to a given age.

Survival rate, g(x): 𝑔(𝑥)=𝑆𝑥+1𝑆𝑥(Eq. 2)
, where 𝑆𝑥
is the number of survivors from the original cohort at year 𝑥
(per-capita survival rate at age x). Survival rate is the probability of survival from age x to age (x+1).

Lifetime reproductive potential: 𝑅0=∑𝑘𝑥=0𝑙(𝑥)⋅𝑏(𝑥)(Eq. 3)
, where 𝑘
is the maximum possible age. Lifetime reproductive potential is the average number of female offspring produced per female over her entire lifetime.

Life Expectancy (for a newborn) can be approximated as: 𝐿𝐸0=∑𝑘𝑥=0𝑆(𝑥+1)+0.5∗𝐷(𝑥)𝑆(0)(Eq. 4)

Q: why is the above estimate for life expectancy (LE) approximate and not exact? Is it likely to be biased or unbiased?
  
  Generation time is defined as the Average age of individuals in the cohort when they produce offspring (for all offspring born to the cohort, record the age of the mom at the time she gave birth, and then take the average of all these ages!). This can be computed as: 𝐺=∑𝑘𝑥=0𝑙(𝑥)⋅𝑏(𝑥)⋅𝑥∑𝑘𝑥=0𝑙(𝑥)⋅𝑏(𝑥)(Eq. 5)

Intrinsic rate of growth, 𝑟
is defined (approximately) as: 𝑟=𝑙𝑛(𝑅0)𝐺(Eq. 6)

lambda, 𝜆
is defined (to a first-order approximation) as: 𝜆=𝑒𝑟
