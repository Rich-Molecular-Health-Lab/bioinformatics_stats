# Before you begin

>You should use this script if you are processing raw sequencing files on our lab's sequencing computer (the System76 laptop). If you plan to run these scripts from a different computer, you should either **1. switch to the original read processing script and remotely access the HCC** or **2. verify that your computer has the  minimum computing requirements needed (only high performance PCs with NVIDA will work) and mirror my dorado directory structure.**
