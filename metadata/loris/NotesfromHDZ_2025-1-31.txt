I think the attached will help with most of the change questions. It outlines each diet formulation. The “mores” and “lesses” are compared to the original diet and between each period all items were reset. So after biscuit elimination phase biscuits were added back in.
 
What does “Sweet potato, green bean, carrot, pumpkin” mean? Were these items at 0 before and now added into rotation?
  - They were in a seasonal vegetable rotation which in theory included each of those except pumpkin. This combination came from Cabana’s recommendation in the attached deck.

How much Metamucil were you giving and how was it administered?
  - Start w half a capsule per day, then increase to 1 full capsule per day. I believe we did 5 days of half a capsule then a full capsule after that. It was mixed in with his gum or an existing part of this diet.

What Rx was given as an anti-diarrheal and in what dose?
  - Laura?

What does low lectin mean in actual diet shift? (like were specific foods removed?)
  - Yes, exact diet is the in the attached Excel but we eliminated biscuits, switched to only egg whites as a protein source, and added specific low lectin veggies and eliminated all others.
  
For the weeks grayed out with blanks under the period column, was he just at the probiotic + steroid + oat, or was he at baseline?
  - He was for sure still getting the oatmeal gel and I believe the probiotic. Janelle or Laura, was he on the steroid 3/5/24-5/28/24?
