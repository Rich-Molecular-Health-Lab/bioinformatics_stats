##### Option 2: Aggregate Over Time Intervals (If Daily Data is Too Noisy)

- **Definition**: Define biological replicates as weekly or monthly time blocks instead of daily samples.
- **Rationale**: 
  - If daily sampling is too granular, grouping into **weekly means** can smooth noise while maintaining temporal resolution.
  - BEEM still detects longitudinal patterns without excessive variation from day-to-day fluctuations.
  
**Example**

```
sample.table <- sample.table %>%
  dplyr::mutate(week = floor(study_day / 7)) %>%  # Group by week
  dplyr::group_by(subject, week) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(across(everything(), mean, na.rm = TRUE))  # Aggregate
```

##### Option 3: Define Replicates Based on Major Perturbations (Event-Based Replicates)

- **Definition**: Consider biological replicates as **time windows around major events** like:
  - **Diet changes**
  - **Medication use (antibiotics, steroids, etc.)**
  - **Health shifts (illness episodes)**
  - **Reproductive states (estrus or pregnancy)**
	
- **Rationale**: 
  - Instead of treating every day as independent, group time points into **pre/post-treatment windows.**
  - BEEM will detect microbial shifts before and after interventions.
  
**Example**

```
metadata_df <- metadata_df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(bio_replicate = paste(subject, diet_name, sep = "_"))  # Replicates per diet phase
```

##### Option 4: Define Replicates Based on Microbiome Stability or Distinct Clusters

- **Definition**: Instead of pre-defining biological replicates by subject/time, use clustering methods (e.g., **beta-diversity clustering**) to define groups.
	
- **Rationale**: 
  - If microbiome shifts occur in distinct phases, cluster samples into **stable states** rather than forcing arbitrary time bins.
  
**Example**

```
dist_matrix <- vegdist(otu_table, method = "bray")  
clusters    <- cutree(hclust(dist_matrix), k = 5)  # 5 microbiome states  
metadata_df$bio_replicate <- clusters
```
