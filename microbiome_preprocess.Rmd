# Preprocessing Overview

In this section we will take raw microbiome count data and turn it into a clean, analysis-ready `phyloseq` object.  You will:

1.	**Load your core inputs**

  - A rooted phylogenetic tree (`refs_tree.treefile`)
    - produced in the [`microbiome_references` tutorial](https://rich-molecular-health-lab.github.io/tutorials/microbiome_references.html).
  - Representative 16S sequences (`refs_aligned_mafft.fasta`)
    - produced in the [`microbiome_references` tutorial](https://rich-molecular-health-lab.github.io/tutorials/microbiome_references.html).
  - A taxonomic assignment table (`tax_table.RData`)
    - produced in the [`microbiome_alignments` tutorial](https://rich-molecular-health-lab.github.io/tutorials/microbiome_alignments.html).
  - Sample metadata (`sample_table.RData`)
    - produced in the [`metadata_setup` tutorial](https://rich-molecular-health-lab.github.io/tutorials/metadata_setup.html) and then prepared for microbiomes in [`microbiome_alignments`]((https://rich-molecular-health-lab.github.io/tutorials/microbiome_alignments.html).
  - An OTU count table (`otu_table.RData`)
    - produced in the [`microbiome_alignments` tutorial](https://rich-molecular-health-lab.github.io/tutorials/microbiome_alignments.html).
	
2.	**Merge replicate samples**

  - Pool all reads for the same subject on the same day into a single sample.  OTU counts are summed, and numeric metadata are averaged.

3.	**Clean up taxonomy & prune**

  - Rename each tip to a simple “OTU1…OTUn” label
  - Remove very low-abundance OTUs (e.g. total count ≤ 1)
  - Collapse your count table and tree to the Genus rank
  - Perform a second pruning step so that only genera with meaningful counts remain

4.	**Save analysis-ready objects**

  - A cleaned, genus-level phyloseq object (`phyloseq_genus.RData`)
  - Its melted version (`phyloseq_melt_genus.RData`) for ggplot workflows
  - The pruned, genus-level tree (`tree_genus.RData`)
  - Analogous objects for Family, Order, Class, and Phylum

## By the end of this stage, you will have one phyloseq object per taxonomic level, each containing:

  - A consistent OTU (or Genus/Family…) count table
  - Matched sample metadata and taxonomic table
  - A pruned phylogenetic tree
  
# Packages Used

In this script we mostly use the `phyloseq` package, designed for microbiome analysis.

## `phyloseq` Utility

- Integrates OTU/ASV tables, sample metadata, taxonomy, phylogenetic trees, and (optionally) reference sequences in one S4 object.
- Provides convenient methods for merging, pruning, rarefaction, distance calculations, and plotting.
- Under the hood, relies on Bioconductor classes (DataFrames, XStringSets, phylo).

>Note: there is much overlap between `phyloseq`, `microeco`, and `microbiome`, but each makes some steps more streamlined than others, so I prefer to switch between them for different stages of analysis.

We will also use the `treedataverse` package suite for some visualization to check in on our data quality.

## `treedataverse` Utility

The `treedataverse` suite provides tools for managing, sharing, and visualizing phylogenetic trees in R. It builds on the Dataverse platform to store trees (and associated data) in versioned, citable repositories. With `treedataverse`, you can:

  - Upload or download phylo objects directly from a Dataverse collection
  - Attach rich metadata (e.g. study details, taxon provenance) to each tree
  - Track updates and collaborate on tree data with full provenance
  - Integrate seamlessly with ggtree and ape for downstream plotting and analysis

### `ggtree` Package within the `treedataverse`

`ggtree` is an extension of `ggplot2` tailored for phylogenetic trees. It lets you:

  - Map tree data (branches, node labels, support values) to aesthetic scales
  - Annotate clades with heatmaps, bar charts, or tip points (e.g. taxon abundances)
  - Collapse or expand subtrees interactively
  - Align associated data (e.g. trait matrices) alongside your tree in multi-panel layouts
  - Leverage the full grammar of graphics for publication-quality figures

# Load Data

>Note that I use `.RData` files to load some of the data below. You could load these same objects in the form of more widely applicable files, if you wish (*see below for explaination*).

<details>
<summary><emph>What is an .RData file?</emph></summary>
<p>An `.RData` (or sometimes `.rda`) file is R’s native, binary workspace format. When you call `save()` on one or more R objects—data frames, matrices, lists, S4/S3 objects, etc.—R serializes them into a compact, platform-independent file. You can later restore those exact objects (with their names and attributes intact) by calling load("`your_file.RData`"). Using `.RData` is an efficient way to cache intermediate steps, share processed datasets with collaborators, or speed up analyses by skipping time-consuming recomputation.</p>
</details>

```{r}
tree <- read.tree("microeco/loris/refs_tree.treefile")
seqs <- readDNAStringSet("microeco/loris/refs_aligned_mafft.fasta")
load("microeco/loris/tax_table.RData")
load("microeco/loris/sample_table.RData")
load("microeco/loris/otu_table.RData")
```

## Sample Metadata as Factors

Phyloseq will only capture numeric/factor values (not strings) for the metadata, so we need to reformat our character columns.

```{r}
sample_data <- sample.table %>%
  arrange(subject, collection_day) %>%
  mutate(subject_certainty       = fct_recode(subject_certainty  , "0" = "no" , "1" = "yes"),
         environment_holding     = fct_recode(environment_holding, "0" = "old", "1" = "new"),
         environment_pair_access = fct_recode(environment_pair_access, "0" = "n", "1" = "y"),
         repro_warb_status       = fct_recode(repro_warb_status, "0" = "anestrus", "1" = "estrus")) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~factor(.))) %>%
  mutate(diet_name = fct_inorder(diet_name))
```
  
## Phyloseq Object

```{r}
phylo <- phyloseq(
  tax_table(as.matrix(tax.table)),
  otu_table(as.matrix(otu.table), taxa_are_rows = TRUE),
  sample_data(sample_data),
  phy_tree(tree),
  refseq(seqs)
)
```

  geom_tippoint(aes(color = Phylum)) +
## Preview Starting Data

```{r}
ggtree(phylo, branch.length = "none", aes(color = Phylum)) + 
  scale_color_paletteer_d("trekcolors::lcars_series") +
  theme_tree(legend.position = "none")
```

That looks like some very dense, messy taxonomic data!

```{r results='asis'}
skimr::skim(as_tibble(sam_data(phylo)))
```


---

# Dereplicate Samples

First we will create a version that merges the replicated samples so that we have one observation per subject per day. This function's default in phyloseq will aggregate the OTU counts across multiple samples as a sum of reads while taking mean values for everything in the metadata.

>This pooling step creates **one composite sample per subject per day**, avoiding pseudo‐replication in downstream diversity metrics.

```{r results='asis'}
phylo_merged <- phylo %>%
  merge_samples("subject_day")


skimr::skim(as_tibble(sam_data(phylo_merged)))
```


# Clean up Taxonomy

## Rename Taxa as OTUs

```{r}
taxa_names(phylo_merged)[1:20]
taxa_names(phylo_merged) <- paste0("OTU", 1:ntaxa(phylo_merged))
taxa_names(phylo_merged)[1:20]
```

## Prune Taxa

Drop the OTUs with the lowest abundances. Constraining your dataset to taxa with >1 total read helps stabilize diversity estimates and speeds up tree operations.  
  
**First let's see how many OTUs we lose at different thresholds**

```{r}
length(taxa_sums(phylo_merged)[taxa_sums(phylo_merged) <= 1])
length(taxa_sums(phylo_merged)[taxa_sums(phylo_merged) <= 2])
```

```{r}
rare_otus <- names(taxa_sums(phylo_merged)[taxa_sums(phylo_merged) <= 1])
keep_otus <- names(taxa_sums(phylo_merged)[taxa_sums(phylo_merged) > 1])

length(rare_otus)
length(keep_otus)
```

We will remove 599 otus where the total abundance is less than or equal to 1 and keep the 1645 otus with a total abundance of at least 2.

```{r}
phylo_pruned <- prune_taxa(keep_otus, phylo_merged)
```


```{r}
view_pruned <- ggtree(phylo_pruned, branch.length = "none", aes(color = Phylum)) + 
  theme_tree(legend.position = "none")

view_pruned
```


## Collapse Taxa to Genus Level

Collapsing at genus level reduces complexity and allows genus‐scale ecological patterns to emerge with less interference from random error at the species-assignment level.

```{r}
phylo_genus <- phylo_pruned %>% tax_glom("Genus")
```

```{r}
taxa_names(phylo_merged)[1:20]
taxa_names(phylo_merged) <- paste0("OTU", 1:ntaxa(phylo_merged))
taxa_names(phylo_merged)[1:20]
```


```{r}
ggtree(phylo_genus, branch.length = "none", aes(color = Phylum)) + 
  theme_tree(legend.position = "none")
```

## Another Pruning Check

Let's look at our OTUs now that we merged to the Genus level

```{r}
length(taxa_sums(phylo_genus)[taxa_sums(phylo_genus) <= 1])
length(taxa_sums(phylo_genus)[taxa_sums(phylo_genus) <= 2])
length(taxa_sums(phylo_genus)[taxa_sums(phylo_genus) > 1])
length(taxa_sums(phylo_genus)[taxa_sums(phylo_genus) > 2])
```

Let's do one more pruning step to only keep the genera with total abundances greater than 2 (613 genera total).

```{r}
rare_genera <- names(taxa_sums(phylo_genus)[taxa_sums(phylo_genus) <= 2])
keep_genera <- names(taxa_sums(phylo_genus)[taxa_sums(phylo_genus) > 2])

length(rare_genera)
length(keep_genera)
```


```{r}
phylo_clean <- prune_taxa(keep_genera, phylo_genus)


ggtree(phylo_clean, branch.length = "none", aes(color = Phylum)) + 
  theme_tree(legend.position = "none")

```

## Extract and Save Clean Phyloseq Objects

Exporting intermediate objects saves time if you need to re‐run later steps without re‐processing.

```{r}
phylo_melt_clean     <- psmelt(phylo_clean)
clean_tree           <- phy_tree(phylo_clean)
save(phylo_clean     , file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_genus.RData")
save(clean_tree      , file = "microeco/loris/tree_genus.RData")
save(phylo_melt_clean, file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_melt_genus.RData")
```

```{r results='asis'}
skimr::skim(phylo_melt_clean)
```


# Subset Additional Taxonomic Levels

Working at multiple ranks lets you compare community structure from broad (Phylum) to fine (Genus) scales in the same pipeline.

```{r}
fam_phylo <- phylo_clean %>% tax_glom("Family")
ord_phylo <- phylo_clean %>% tax_glom("Order")
cla_phylo <- phylo_clean %>% tax_glom("Class")
phy_phylo <- phylo_clean %>% tax_glom("Phylum")
```


```{r}
ggtree(fam_phylo, branch.length = "none", aes(color = Phylum)) + 
  geom_label(aes(x = branch, label = Order)) +
  theme_tree(legend.position = "none")
```


```{r}
ggtree(ord_phylo, branch.length = "none")
ggtree(cla_phylo, branch.length = "none")
ggtree(phy_phylo, branch.length = "none")
```

## Extract and Save for Other Levels

```{r}
ggtree(fam_phylo, branch.length = "none") + 
  geom_tippoint(aes(color = Phylum)) +
  scale_color_paletteer_d("ggthemes::Hue_Circle") +
  theme_tree(legend.position = "none")
```


```{r}
fam_phylo_melt     <- psmelt(fam_phylo)
ord_phylo_melt     <- psmelt(ord_phylo)
cla_phylo_melt     <- psmelt(cla_phylo)
phy_phylo_melt     <- psmelt(phy_phylo)

fam_tree           <- phy_tree(fam_phylo)
ord_tree           <- phy_tree(ord_phylo)
cla_tree           <- phy_tree(cla_phylo)
phy_tree           <- phy_tree(phy_phylo)

save(fam_phylo     , file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_family.RData")
save(ord_phylo     , file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_order.RData")
save(cla_phylo     , file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_class.RData")
save(phy_phylo     , file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_phylum.RData")

save(fam_tree      , file = "microeco/loris/tree_family.RData")
save(ord_tree      , file = "microeco/loris/tree_order.RData")
save(cla_tree      , file = "microeco/loris/tree_class.RData")
save(phy_tree      , file = "microeco/loris/tree_phylum.RData")

save(fam_phylo_melt, file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_melt_family.RData")
save(ord_phylo_melt, file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_melt_order.RData")
save(cla_phylo_melt, file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_melt_class.RData")
save(phy_phylo_melt, file = "microeco/loris/phyloseq_melt_phylum.RData")
```

# Next Steps

In the [`microbiome_metrics` tutorial](https://rich-molecular-health-lab.github.io/tutorials/microbiome_metrics.html) you will learn how to choose and apply rarefaction or relative-abundance normalization, and then calculate fundamental diversity statistics (α-diversity indices, β-diversity distances, UniFrac, etc.).  Refer to that section to decide when and how to rarefy your merged tables, or to work directly on normalized counts for non-phylogenetic metrics.
